/**
 An `AppteniveVersion` represents a version number. In the preferred case, the
 version consists of one to three nonnegative integers separated by periods.
 These will be parsed into the major, minor, and patch values. If the minor
 and/or patch versions are not specified, they will be assumed to be zero for
 purposes of equality with other version objects.
 
 If the version uses a different format, the major, minor, and patch numbers
 will be set to negative one, and equality will be determined by the whether
 the version string is an exact match.
 
 If the version argument is nil or empty, it will default to 0.0.0.
